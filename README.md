  `save` local pgn files to the database.

### Fetch games from chess.com or lichess.org

`username` and `output` are required when using `fetch` to download, parse, and save your games to your database. `fetch` accepts with `chess` or `lichess` as an argument for _[chess.com](https://www.chess.com)_ and _[lichess.org](https://lichess.org)_ respectively.

Example:

```shell
pgn-to-sqlite -u endlesstrax -o data.db fetch lichess
```

> If you've played a lot of games, **be patient**, it could take a minute or two.

### Save games from local folder

`output` is required when saving games from local pgn files to your database. `save` expects a folder path as an argument.

Example:

```shell
pgn-to-sqlite -o data.db save .\chess\games\
```

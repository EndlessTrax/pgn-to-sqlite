A cli application for pulling pgn files from Chess.com and Lichess.org and putting your games into a sqlite database.

## Install

> Requires Python 3.6 and above.

MacOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pgn_to_sqlite
```

Windows:

```powershell
python -m pip install pgn_to_sqlite
```

## Usage

The cli expects three arguments: `site`, `username`, and `output`.

`site`: can be with `chess` or `lichess`, for [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org), respectively.

`-u username`: The username of the user you wish to download games of.

`-o output`: should be a `path` to the `sqlite3` database.

### Example

```powershell
pgn-to-sqlite lichess -u myusername -o data.db
```

> If you've played a lot of games, **be patient**, it could take a minute or two.
